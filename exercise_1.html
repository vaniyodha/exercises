                in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of
                Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan
                to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of
                Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
                Myanmar and Indonesia.

            <p>Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24][25][26]
                Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
                highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[27] Settled life emerged on the
                subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into
                the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[28] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,
                an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[29][30]</p>

            <p>unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[31] The
                Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[32] By 400 BCE,
                stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[33] and Buddhism and Jainism had
                arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[34] Early political consolidations gave rise to
                the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[35] Their collective era was suffused
                with wide-ranging creativity,[36] but also marked by the declining status of women,[37] and the
                incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][38] In South India, the Middle
                kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast
                Asia.[39]</p>

            <p>In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's
                southern and western coasts.[40] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern
                plains,[41] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the
                cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[42] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
                long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[43] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
                institutionalised religion.[44] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
                peace,[45] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][46] Gradually expanding rule of the British
                East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
                sovereignty.[47] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
                slowly,[48][49] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the
                public life took root.[50] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted
                for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[51] In 1947 the British
                Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
                Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[52]

            <p>India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
                pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to
                1.211 billion in 2011.[53] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64
                annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute
                country in 1951,[54] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology
                services, with an expanding middle class.[55] It has a space programme which includes several planned or
                completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing
                role in global culture.[56] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of
                increasing economic inequality.[57] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military
                expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the
                mid-20th century.[58] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child
                malnutrition,[59] and rising levels of air pollution.[60] India's land is megadiverse, with four
                biodiversity hotspots.[61] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[62] India's wildlife, which has
                traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[63] is supported among these forests, and
                elsewhere, in protected habitats.</p>

            <h1>Etymology</h1>
            <hr>
            <span>Main article: Names of India</span>
            <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the
                Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn
                derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian
                Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu,
                or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[64][65]
                The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the
                Indus".[66</p>
            <p>The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (audio speaker iconlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic
                poetry and the Constitution of India,[67][68] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A
                modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to northern
                India,[69][70] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for
                India.[67][71] </p>
            <p>Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced
                during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region
                encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[67][71][72] </p>

                    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian
                        subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[24][25][26] The earliest known modern
                        human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[24] After 6500 BCE, evidence for
                        domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of
                        agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan,
                        Pakistan.[74] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[75][74] the first
                        urban culture in South Asia,[76] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan
                        and western India.[77] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and
                        Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in
                        crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[76]
                    </p>
                    <p>During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the
                        Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[78] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with
                        Hinduism,[79] were composed during this period,[80] and historians have analysed these to posit
                        a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[78] Most historians also
                        consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the
                        subcontinent from the north-west.[79] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests,
                        warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their
                        occupations impure, arose during this period.[81] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence
                        from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[78] In
                        South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic
                        monuments dating from this period,[82] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation
                        tanks, and craft traditions.[82]</p><img
                        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Cave_26%2C_Ajanta.jpg/576px-Cave_26%2C_Ajanta.jpg">
                    <span>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the
                        Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and
                        monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[89][90] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to
                        non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into
                        prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[91] Buddhism, based on the teachings of
                        Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class;
                        chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in
                        India.[92][93][94] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as
                        an ideal,[95] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd
                        century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan
                        Empire.[96] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the
                        far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous
                        areas.[97][98] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined
                        management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of
                        the Budd</span>
                    <p>The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the
                        southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded
                        extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[101][102] In North India,
                        Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of
                        women.[103][96] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of
                        administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later
                        Indian kingdoms.[104][105] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than
                        the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[106] This renewal was reflected in a flowering
                        of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[105] Classical Sanskrit
                        literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made
                        significant advances.[105]</p>

                    <span>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and
                        cultural diversity.[107] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from
                        606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the
                        Deccan.[108] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king
                        of Bengal.[108] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the
                        Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still
                        farther south.[108] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently
                        control lands much beyond their core region.[107] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land
                        had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within
                        caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[109] The caste system consequently
                        began to show regional differences.[109]</span>
                    <span>In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil
                        language.[110] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and
                        the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[110] Indian royalty, big and small,
                        and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which
                        became economic hubs as well.[111] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as
                        India underwent another urbanisation.[111] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt
                        in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that
                        became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and
                        Java.[112] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission;
                        South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and
                        translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[112]</span>
                    <span>After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and
                        raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's
                        north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in
                        1206.[113] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South
                        India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast
                        non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[114][115] By repeatedly repulsing
                        Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on
                        West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned
                        men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby
                        creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[116][117] The sultanate's raiding and
                        weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara
                        Empire.[118] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of
                        the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[119] and was to influence
                        South Indian society for long afterwards.[118]</span>

                <span>In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[120] fell again to the
                    superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[121] The resulting
                    Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and
                    pacified them through new administrative practices[122][123] and diverse and inclusive ruling
                    elites,[124] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[125] Eschewing tribal bonds
                    and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through
                    loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[124] The
                    Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[126] and mandating that
                    taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[127] caused peasants and artisans to enter
                    larger markets.[125] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was
                    a factor in India's economic expansion,[125] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary
                    forms, textiles, and architecture.[128] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India,
                    such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during
                    Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military
                    experience.[129] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and
                    political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[129] As the empire disintegrated,
                    many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[130]</span>
                <span>By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being
                    increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India
                    Company, had established coastal outposts.[131][132] The East India Company's control of the seas,
                    greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert
                    its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these
                    factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and
                    sideline the other European companies.[133][131][134][135] Its further access to the riches of
                    Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue
                    most of India by the 1820s.[136] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long
                    had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this
                    to be the onset of India's colonial period.[131] By this time, with its economic power severely
                    curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British
                    administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education,
                    social reform, and culture.[137]</span>
